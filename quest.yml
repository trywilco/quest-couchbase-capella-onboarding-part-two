title: Couchbase Capella Onboarding - Part 2
subtitle: Build a RAG Application with Couchbase and Node.js
description: >-
  Welcome to Part 2 of the Couchbase Capella onboarding quest! This module builds upon the foundations set in Part 1 to create a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) application.


  You'll integrate your existing Couchbase cluster, vector embeddings, and vector search index into a React frontend and Node.js backend application.


  Learn to use Couchbase Capella's capabilities for vector similarity search and augmented query responses.


  By the end, you'll have a fully functional RAG application, showcasing Couchbase's potential in modern AI-driven applications.
